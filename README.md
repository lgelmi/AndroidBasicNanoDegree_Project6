# AndroidBasicNanoDegree_Project6
The Appington Post

This project target is to realize a news app to display news from the Guardian API. 

Beside what required by the project rubric, the main features are:
* Swipe for update: as in many other apps, swiping up will update the news.
* Thumbnils: each news is associated with an image kindly offered by the guardian.

**N.B.:** The /Credits.txt file stores all resource original sources.
