# AndroidBasicNanoDegree_Project6
The Appington Post

This project target is to realize a news app to display news from the Guardian API. 

Beside what required by the project rubric, the main features are:
* Swipe for update: as in many other apps, swiping up will update the news.
* Thumbnils: each news is associated with an image kindly offered by the guardian.

## Settings update

For the second part of the project some settings have been added:
* Section: the user can choose what kind of news he'd like to read. I spent a lot of time trying to fill the section list through the Guardian's API, sadly I found it much more difficult than forseeable due to the project structure. Being lazy as I am, I preferred to hard-code a sublist of sections. 
* Order: results can be ordered either by newest or oldest. 
* Page Size: from 1 to 50 news can be seen at a time.

**N.B.:** The /Credits.txt file stores all resource original sources.
